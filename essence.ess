# a language that is just an advanced type system lol

# declare a type with `:`
number: int | float

# functions are types, using `->`
add_1: number -> number + 1

# use type aliases to differentiate types in functions
n1: number
n2: number
add: n1 -> n2 -> n1 + n2

# basically its inspired by the fact that in haskell
# you can often figure out what a function does just
# based on it's type signature
